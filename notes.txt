To Do:
- The thing where citations for the wrong project flash before you see correct citations
- Wrong projects flash in dashboard before you see correct projects

- Restructure database:
- Users
	- username
	- initial
	- projects
		- createdAt
		- description
		- title
		- userID
		- citations
			- authorFirstName
			- authorLastName
			- createdAt

Later:
- Database rules
- CSS
- "No Projects" and "No Citations"
- Forgot Password
- Delete account
- Delete Project
- Delete Citation
- Add citation capabilities:
	- Journal
	- Multiple authors
	- Multiple citation styles
- Find background image and put in image folder (Canucks mode)
- Issue with project not loading on refresh

Planning:
- App - Root compontent
	- Nav Bar - showing on every route
		- Signed in links
		- Signed out links
	- /Dashboard
		- Buttons for "My Citations" and "Create Citation"
	- /Sign In
	- /Sign Up
	- /My Citations
		- List of all historical citations
	- /Create Citations
	- /Create Website Citation
	- /Create Journal Citation
	- /Create....
